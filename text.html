  a higher priority of changing these specific elements. Class > generic element.

  <!--Here are the text elements which can modify the specific words.
  3 most common types are strong -> Makes bold letters
  <u> for underlining
  <span> has no style but this element can be provided with a class which can be modified with user-defined CSS
  The <u> and <Strong> can also have a class but they are conditional as they already come with default styles.-->
